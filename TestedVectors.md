# Tested Vectors

## TransferrableOwnership zero-owner initialization
- Severity: Medium
- Test: `forge test --match-path test/solidity/Security/TransferrableOwnershipZero.t.sol`
- Result: Constructor accepts address(0) as owner, leaving contract without an owner and blocking future ownership transfers.

## RelayFacet reentrancy on `swapAndStartBridgeTokensViaRelay`
- Severity: High
- Tool: `slither`
- Result: External calls occur before state mutation of `consumedIds`, enabling reentrancy to reuse a request ID.

## GenericSwapFacetV3 arbitrary ETH transfer
- Severity: High
- Tool: `slither`
- Result: Uses low-level calls to transfer ETH to arbitrary receiver, allowing reentrancy before event emission.
